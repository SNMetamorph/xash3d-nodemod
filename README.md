# GS-NODEMOD
This is an integration of Node JS directly into GoldSource, something like amxmod (and my old luamod)
> compatible with xash3d

## Features
* high performance (with V8 engine)
* asynchronous
* lightness (JS is very light)
* high support (npm modules and more JS code)

## Directory structure
```
|-- /
|-- deps                       # 3rdparty dependencies
|-- scripts                    # auxiliary scripts (generating the autocode)
|-- src                        # nodemod source files
|  |-- auto                    # auto-generated code
|  |  |-- dll_events.cpp       # events from gamedll
|  |  |-- engine_events.cpp    # events from engine
|  |  |-- engine_functions.cpp # bindings to engine methods
|  |-- lib                     # nodemod library external api to metamod
|  |-- node                    # v8 and nodejs internal code and api
|  |-- structures              # structures between engine and jscode
|  |-- bindings                # util methods and core functional, passed to JS
```

## Compilation
Pre-installing dependencies
```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib cmake nodejs libuv1-dev
```
  
Compilation requires node js installed.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheEVolk/xash3d-nodemod.git
cd xash3d-nodemod
node scripts/buildEvents.js
cmake -E make_directory build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

## Installation and launch
> ⚠️ we are planning to move examples to another repository

1. Install metamod in your game server
2. Create a nodemod directory in addons
3. Move all files from example to `addons/nodemod`
4. Create the `addons/nodemod/dlls` directory
5. Move the compiled libnodemod.so to the `addons/nodemod/dlls` directory
6. In plugins.ini from metamod, add the line `linux addons/nodemod/dlls/libnodemod.so`
7. Install npm or yarn and run the command `npm i` for npm or `yarn` for yarn in the addons/nodemod directory
8. You can write your scripts in the 'addons/nodemod/src` directory.

## TypeScript
you can run your typescript code using the [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) library

1. Install ts-node: `npm i ts-node`
2. Pass there env variable to your start script: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--loader ts-node/esm"`
3. Make sure that the main field is in your package.json leads to a TS file

## RoadMap
- Fix all existing crashes.
- Write a `@types/gs-nodemod` library, for easy coding on typescript.
